# Intro to Control Statements

This section, the first in the Control Statements chapter, deals with the three primary categories of control statements: 

- sequential statements

- selection statements

- repetition statements (loops)

Sequential control statements (one after another) are the default. This is what we have done so far: each line ending in a semicolon is executed in sequence.

Selection statements allow us to control the flow of code based on conditions of, for example, variables in our code.

Repetition statements allow us to repeat ("loop") execution of certain statements until some condition is met.
