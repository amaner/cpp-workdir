# Jam Project

Simulates a "jam of the month" club. The club has three offerings:

- Package A: $8/month, includes 2 jams per month, and each additional jam is $5

- Package B: $12/month, includes 4 jams, and each additional is $4 

- Package C: $15/month, includes 6 jams, and each additional is $3

Prompt the user for the package to which they currently subscribe, then prompt
the user for the total number of jams they wish to purchase (if any). Calculate the monthly fee and inform the user what they owe.
