# Bugs

In this section we covered the use of the VS Code (or VS Community, in the case of the instructor) debugger. We looked at the following:

- Running with debugging (in VS Code this is just Run -> Start Debugging or click the bug icon -> click Run and Debug)
- Setting breakpoints (in VS Code you just click left of the line number to set a breakpoint, then click again to remove it)
    - Continue (keep going until next breakpoint)
    - Step into (step into a function and go line-by-line inside of it)
    - Step over (treat the function call as a single statement)
    - Step out (if you're inside of a function, go back to the calling function)
    - Stop (obvious)
    - Restart (obvious)
- Setting watch variables (right-click on variable and choose "add to watch", at least in VS Code)
- The Call Stack (see where in the stack you currently are and watch as things are pushed onto and popped off the stack)
