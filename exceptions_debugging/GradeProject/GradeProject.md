# Grade Project

This assignment asked us to create a function that takes as input an integer between 0 and 100, and returns as char a letter grade (F, D, C, B, A). Further, we were asked to have the function throw an out_of_range error if the user input is less than 0 or greater than 100, then have main catch the error.
