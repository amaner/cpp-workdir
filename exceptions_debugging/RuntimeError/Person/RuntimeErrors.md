# Runtime Errors

- Runtime errors
    - runtime_error class
    - typically external errors, originating outside the program
    - often outside our control
        - and therefore not a result of bad practice
    - we write **defensive code** that responds to such unusual situations
- We can **throw** exceptions ourselves
    - this sends the signal that an exception occurred
