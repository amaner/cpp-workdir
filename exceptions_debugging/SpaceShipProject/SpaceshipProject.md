# Spaceship Project

This assignment asked us to write a custom exception class **WarpDriveOverheating** which inherits from overflow_error. We were then asked to write a test function (warpTest()) in main that would throw a WarpDriveOverheating error when a drive core temp of over 80C is reached. This error is then caught and handled in main.
