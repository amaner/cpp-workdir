# Sequential File IO

* File I/O
    * **File input/output**
    * Used when we need to maintain data persistence
    * This content will focus on output - writing data to files
* Main memory
    * Memory or RAM
    * Where data (variables) and instructions (statements, functions) live
    * Main memory is fast, but volatile
* Secondary memory
    * Slow, but persistent

* This exercise creates an ofstream and then writes formatted output to it
