# Shopping List

In this exercise, we were asked to read a list of items from a provided file containing a shopping list, count how many times each unique item appears in that list, and then output to console the list of unique items and their frequencies.

I chose to use the std::find() function to determine if a given input item was already in the list, and std:distance() to find the index of the item if it is.
