# Function Overloading

This section introduces the concept of overloading functions. The signature of a function is its name, together with its parameters. The compiler distinguishes between each overload by including the number and type of parameters, together with the return type.

In this example, we make three functions with the same name getResult(). Two have return type int, while the other has return type string. One takes two integer parameters, another takes a single integer parameter, and the third takes two string parameters.
