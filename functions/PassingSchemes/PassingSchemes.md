# Parameter Passing

Pass-by-value

    - The default parameter passing scheme
    - Can think of it as "pass by copy"

Pass-by-reference

    - Allows more control to the function
    - Parameter acts as an alias for the variable from the calling function
    - Values of parameters passed by reference that are changed reflect the change
    in the argument passed to them
