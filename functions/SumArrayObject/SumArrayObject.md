# Sum Array Object

In this exercise, we were asked to sum the elements of an array object. We were asked to do this two ways:

    - First, using a function that takes only an array object as a parameter and returned the integer sum.
    - Second, using a void overload function that takes the array object and a variable to hold the sum (via pass by reference).
