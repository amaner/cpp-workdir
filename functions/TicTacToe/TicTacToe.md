# Tic Tac Toe

This assignment asked us to come up with a solution for a Tic Tac Toe game. This is quick and dirty, and definitely not DRY. Moreover, it has no error handling, but it's a first pass using only what the class has covered to this point. 

As we progress, I'll refactor this to make it better.
