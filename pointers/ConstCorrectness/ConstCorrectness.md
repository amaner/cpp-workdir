# Constant Correctness

* **Const Correctness** refers to how to use the **const** keyword correctly different circumstances
    * For our purposes, specifically circumstances involving pointers

* Four scenarios we cover here:
    * **Non-constant pointer** to **non-constant data**
    * **Constant pointer** to **non-constant data**
