# Dynamic Memory 1

* Dynamic memory
    * Is allocated at **runtime** instead of being set at compile time
    * Useful because often we don't know how many of certain variables we will need

* C++ syntax for dynamic memory
    * The **new** keyword allows us to reserve memory on the **free store**, commonly known as the **heap**
    * The **delete** keyword is for returning dynamically allocated memory when no longer needed
