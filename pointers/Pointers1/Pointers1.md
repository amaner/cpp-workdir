# Pointers 1    

* Pointers
    * Also called *pointer variables*
    * Holds a memory address
    * Refer to the data of interest *indirectly*

* Declaring a pointer
    * int* myPtr; // not an integer - it's a pointer to an integer
    * Using ptr or Ptr in the identifier is common practice

* If you declare multiple vars per line
    * int *myPtr1, *myPtr2, *myPtr3;


* Three situations where we use the asterisk
    * between data type and identifier in **pointer declaration**
    * as the unary **dereference operator**
    * as the binary **multiplcation operator**

* So, * is an overloaded operator
